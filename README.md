## App Overview

My app, **Event Tracker**, is designed to help users organize and manage their personal and professional events in one convenient place. I was originally inspired by a personal coach of mine, and the class project gave me the opportunity to pursue this idea practically. Users can log in securely, add events with important details like title, date, and description, and view all their events displayed in a user-friendly grid layout. Events can be edited or deleted, ensuring users have flexibility in managing their schedules.

In future updates, I plan to integrate SMS notifications to remind users about upcoming events, making the app even more valuable for staying on top of important dates.

## App Description

Event Tracker is your simple yet powerful tool to manage personal and professional events. Quickly add events, set dates and details, and view your schedule at a glance. Stay organized and never miss an important date again!

### Key Features:

- Easy account creation and secure login
- Add, edit, and delete events
- Clean, modern grid view of all events
- Plans for SMS notifications in future updates

This app is perfect for anyone looking to keep life organized—whether for work meetings, personal appointments, or special occasions.

I envision the app icon as a modern calendar or event symbol, featuring a clean design in purple tones to match the app’s color scheme. The icon should be simple yet recognizable, with a small checkmark or star to represent tracking and prioritization.

## Android Versions Supported

My app is developed using Android Studio and targets:

- **Minimum SDK:** API Level 21 (Android 5.0 Lollipop)
- **Target SDK:** API Level 33 (Android 13)

I chose this range to ensure broad compatibility across older and newer devices while maintaining support for modern UI and security features. I’ve used libraries like AndroidX and Material Design to keep the app consistent with current Android standards.

---

## Permissions Requested

My app requests the following permission:

- **SEND_SMS**

This permission is necessary for sending SMS notifications to remind users about their upcoming events. However, I’ve implemented the logic so the app continues to function normally even if the user denies SMS permission. In that case, notifications won’t be sent, but all other app features remain fully usable.

No other unnecessary permissions are requested, aligning with privacy best practices and ensuring users feel secure using the app.

## Monetization Plan

At this stage, Event Tracker is intended as a free tool with no ads or in-app purchases. My priority is to deliver a smooth, user-friendly experience without distractions.

However, I’m considering potential monetization in future updates, such as:

- A premium version with advanced features (e.g., recurring events, advanced reminders, color-coded calendars)
- An optional subscription model for business users needing multiple calendars or team sharing features
- Carefully placed, non-intrusive ads if needed to offset costs

My primary goal is to keep the app accessible and user-friendly while exploring sustainable ways to support ongoing development.

## Launch Strategy

Once finalized and fully tested, I plan to release Event Tracker on the Google Play Store. My launch strategy will include:

- Writing a clear, engaging Play Store description highlighting key benefits
- Designing an appealing app icon and screenshots for the store listing
- Sharing the app on social media and among personal networks to gather initial users and feedback
- Collecting user feedback for future improvements and feature development

I’m committed to maintaining and updating the app based on user input to ensure it remains a helpful tool for event management.

I’m proud of how Event Tracker has come together and believe it offers a practical solution for organizing daily life. The app is stable, user-friendly, and ready for launch, with plans for future growth and additional features like SMS notifications.

## Reflection

**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

The goal of Event Tracker was to help users manage and organize their personal and professional events in one place. It addresses the need for people to stay on top of important dates and commitments and to have the flexibility to edit, delete, or view their schedules at any time. My inspiration came from realizing how essential it is to manage time effectively both in personal life and in professional settings.

---

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

The essential screens were login/signup, a grid-based dashboard for events, and screens to add or edit event details. I focused on a clean, modern layout with intuitive navigation so users could easily understand how to use the app without a learning curve. Consistent design, clear icons, and readable typography contributed to the app’s success in providing a user-centered experience.

---

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?**

I approached coding by breaking down the app into modular parts, focusing separately on UI, business logic, and data handling. I used Android Studio’s tools to ensure components were reusable and followed best practices like separating UI from the database layer. This modular strategy can be applied to future projects, making apps easier to maintain and expand.

---

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?**

I tested the app using Android Studio’s emulator across different screen sizes and API levels. I also performed manual testing to check user interactions, data storage, and error handling. This testing revealed some layout issues on smaller devices, which I adjusted to improve usability. Testing is crucial because it ensures the app works as intended and provides a good user experience.

---

**Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

One challenge was designing the grid layout to display events in a way that was visually appealing and flexible for different amounts of data. I experimented with various layouts before choosing a card-based grid that adjusts dynamically. This innovation improved both usability and the professional appearance of the app.

---

**In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

I’m particularly proud of the way I integrated the SQLite database with the app’s UI, enabling seamless CRUD operations. The system updates the grid view immediately when events are added, edited, or deleted, demonstrating my understanding of data handling and UI synchronization in mobile development.
